## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately with:

If private reporting channels are not yet configured for this repository, contact the maintainer directly and request a temporary private channel.

## Response Expectations

- Initial acknowledgment: within 5 business days
- Status updates: as fixes are investigated and prepared
- Disclosure: coordinated disclosure after a fix is available
